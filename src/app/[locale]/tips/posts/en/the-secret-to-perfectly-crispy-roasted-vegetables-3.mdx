Roasting vegetables is one of the easiest and most delicious ways to prepare them, but achieving that perfectly crispy texture can be tricky. Here’s a simple tip to ensure your vegetables turn out golden, crispy, and irresistible every time.

## The Key Ingredient: High Heat

The secret to crispy roasted vegetables is cooking them at a high temperature. Roasting at around 425°F (220°C) allows the vegetables to caramelize and crisp up on the outside while keeping the inside tender. 

## Don’t Overcrowd the Pan

One common mistake when roasting vegetables is overcrowding the baking sheet. When vegetables are too close together, they steam rather than roast, preventing that crispy texture. To avoid this, make sure the vegetables are spread out in a single layer with some space between them.

## Use the Right Oil

To help achieve a crispy texture, it’s essential to use oil with a high smoke point, such as olive oil, avocado oil, or vegetable oil. Toss the vegetables generously in oil, which will help them brown and crisp as they cook. 

## Season Well

While olive oil is great for crisping, don't forget about the seasoning. Salt is a must, but feel free to experiment with other spices such as garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, or thyme for added depth of flavor.

## Flip Halfway Through

For even crispiness, be sure to flip your vegetables halfway through the roasting time. This ensures that all sides are exposed to the hot oven air, making them perfectly crisp on every side.

## The Final Touch

Once your vegetables are roasted to golden perfection, give them a final sprinkle of sea salt or a drizzle of balsamic glaze to add an extra layer of flavor. 

## The Verdict

By following these simple steps—high heat, proper spacing, and the right oil and seasoning—you can master the art of crispy roasted vegetables. It’s an easy, foolproof way to elevate any meal, from a simple side dish to a main course.

Bon appétit!
