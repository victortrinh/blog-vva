## Mushroom Magic: Crispy, Golden Bites for Two

For a date night, I decided to surprise my vegetarian date with a dish of deep-fried oyster mushrooms made to mimic calamari. 
As I served it, she took a bite and immediately said, "Wow, this tastes just like calamari!" 
When I told her it was mushrooms, she was genuinely confused. The texture and flavor were so like the real thing that she couldn't believe it. 
We spent the rest of the evening enjoying the dish and laughing, proving that a creative twist on a classic can make for an unforgettable date night.

## What Makes These Deep-Fried Oyster Mushrooms Taste Like Calamari?

To make these deep-fried oyster mushrooms taste like real calamari, I focus on two key elements: texture and flavor:

- **Texture**: Oyster mushrooms have a naturally tender and slightly chewy bite when fried, like the texture of calamari.
- **Flavor**: To enhance the sea-like flavor, I soak the mushrooms in kombu (a type of seaweed) before frying. This adds a subtle, briny profile, mimicking the oceanic taste of traditional calamari.

The combination of the mushrooms' texture and the seaweed infusion creates a perfect vegetarian alternative to calamari, offering all the flavor and satisfaction without the seafood.

## Why King Oyster Mushrooms Are the Perfect Calamari Substitute

King oyster mushrooms are an ideal choice for these vegetarian calamari recipe due to their firm, meaty texture, which closely resembles the chewiness of traditional calamari when fried. 
The thick stems offer a satisfying "bite," mimicking the experience of eating seafood. 
Their mild flavor also allows the kombu soak to infuse the mushrooms with a delicate sea-like taste, making them the perfect calamari substitute for a plant-based dish.

## Ingredients

![Vegetarian Calamari Ingredients](/images/recipes/calamari/DSCF2266.jpg)

### Mushrooms

- 3 to 4 king oyster mushrooms
- 2 lemon wedges, for garnish
- 1.5 cups kombu
- Finely chopped parsley (optional), for garnish
- Vegetable oil, for frying

### Batter

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon dry oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

### Ingredients and Their Role in the Dish:

- **King oyster mushrooms**: The main ingredient, offering a meaty, firm texture that mimics traditional calamari, with a subtle sea-like flavor after soaking in kombu.
- **Kombu**: Used to soak the mushrooms, this seaweed imparts a briny, oceanic flavor, enhancing the calamari-like experience.
- **Lemon wedges**: Adds a tangy burst of freshness that balances the richness of the fried mushrooms and brightens up the dish.
- **Chopped parsley**: An optional garnish that adds color and a fresh herbal note to the dish.
- **Vegetable oil**: Essential for frying, creating a crispy exterior while maintaining the mushrooms' tender interior.

### For the batter:

- **All-purpose flour**: Forms the base of the batter, providing structure and a crisp coating for the mushrooms.
- **Cornstarch**: Contributes to a lighter, crunchier batter, enhancing the crispness when fried.
- **Baking powder**: Adds lift to the batter, helping it achieve a light, airy texture.
- **Oregano**: Provides an earthy, fragrant flavor that complements the fried mushrooms.
- **Black pepper**: Adds mild heat and depth, balancing the other seasonings.
- **Cayenne pepper**: Delivers a subtle kick of heat, elevating the flavor profile of the dish.

## Preparation

![King oyster mushroom](/images/recipes/calamari/DSCF2886.jpg)

1. Slice the king oyster mushroom stems into 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Set aside the mushroom tops for another use.

2. For each mushroom round, use a ½-inch round cookie cutter or the end of a metal piping tip to punch out the center of each slice. You'll batter and fry these inner circles as well.

3. Soak the mushroom slices (with the punched-out circles) in kombu for at least 15-20 minutes to infuse them with a subtle sea-like flavor.

4. Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a large pot with a thermometer to 350°F. If using a pot, ensure there's at least 2 inches of oil on the bottom for proper frying.

5. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon dry oregano, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper.

6. Add water gradually, whisking until you achieve a pancake-like batter. The batter should cling to the mushrooms without dripping off.

7. Working in batches, add half of the mushroom pieces to the batter, tossing to coat evenly. Tap off any excess batter and carefully add the pieces to the hot oil, a few at a time.

8. Use a wooden spoon or chopsticks to separate the pieces while frying, preventing them from sticking together.

9. Fry the mushroom pieces for about 2 minutes on each side, until golden brown, for a total of 4 to 5 minutes.

10. Remove the fried mushrooms using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a paper towel-lined baking sheet or platter to drain.

11. Repeat the frying process until all mushrooms are cooked.

12. Just before serving, squeeze fresh lemon juice over the vegan calamari. Serve with tzatziki sauce or your preferred dipping sauce, such as vegan cocktail sauce or a homemade ketchup and horseradish mixture.

## Tips for Perfect "Calamari"

### Soak the Mushrooms in Kombu

Let the king oyster mushrooms soak in kombu for at least 30 minutes. This step infuses them with a subtle sea-like flavor that mimics the taste of traditional calamari, elevating the dish's authenticity.

### Maintain the Right Oil Temperature

Fry the mushrooms at a steady 350°F to ensure they cook evenly and become crispy without absorbing too much oil. A thermometer helps keep the temperature consistent for the best results.

### Double Fry for Extra Crispiness

For the ultimate crunch, fry the mushrooms twice: once to cook them through, and again for a quick second fry to achieve a golden, crispy exterior that perfectly complements the tender interior.

## Flirty Date Night Activities While Cooking Vegan "Calamari"

1. Mushroom Slicing Duel

Challenge each other to slice the mushrooms as thinly as possible. 
The person with the thinnest slice gets to playfully “teach” the other how to do it better or gets a sweet compliment. 
It's a fun, flirty competition to keep things lighthearted.

2. Batter Dip Off

As you dip the mushrooms into the batter, make it a little flirty by teasing each other about who's more skilled at coating them evenly. 
You can playfully “accidentally” get some batter on each other's hands, then have a laugh and share a quick kiss for the mess.

3. Fry and Flip Fun

Take turns frying the mushrooms but add a little competition: whoever flips the mushroom the best gets to pick the music for the night or steal a kiss. 
The sizzling oil isn't the only thing heating up in the kitchen!
