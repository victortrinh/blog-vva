## Falling for Cauliflower: A Soup That Stole the Show

I once had a date where we were feeling adventurous and decided to cook together. I had some leftover truffle oil and a head of cauliflower, so I roasted garlic and whipped up a creamy cauliflower soup. We laughed, tasted the soup, and watched the truffle oil elevate the dish into something unexpectedly luxurious. The night was filled with fun, and that simple yet elegant soup became our cozy, go-to dish for special nights in.

## Ingredients

+ ½ large head cauliflower, florets (roughly 1 pound)
+ 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
+ ½ medium yellow onion, diced
+ 1 head garlic, top removed to expose cloves
+ 1 tablespoon salted butter
+ 1 bay leaf
+ 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
+ 2 cups chicken broth (or vegetable)
+ ¼ cup heavy cream
+ 1 teaspoon white truffle oil 

Cauliflower: The main ingredient, offering a mild, nutty flavor that creates the smooth and creamy base for the soup.\
Olive oil: Used to sauté the onion and garlic, helping to develop a rich flavor base for the soup.\
Yellow onion: Adds sweetness and depth to the soup, balancing the cauliflower's earthy flavor.\
Garlic: Roasted to bring out its natural sweetness and to add depth and richness to the overall flavor profile.\
Salted butter: Adds richness and a velvety texture, enhancing the creaminess of the soup.\
Bay leaf: Infuses the soup with a subtle, aromatic flavor, creating a savory, herbal backdrop.\
Fresh thyme: Adds a fragrant, earthy note that complements the cauliflower and balances its flavor.\
Chicken broth: Acts as the soup's base, providing depth and a savory foundation to bring all the flavors together.\
Heavy cream: Adds a luxurious, creamy texture, making the soup velvety and indulgent.\
White truffle oil: A finishing touch (optional) that infuses the soup with a hint of earthy, luxurious flavor, elevating the dish and adding a touch of elegance.

## Prepare

1. Preheat the Oven: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425ºF. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Prepare Garlic: Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil over the head of garlic, then season with salt and pepper. Wrap the garlic in foil, covering it entirely.
3. Roast Cauliflower: Spread cauliflower florets in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Place the wrapped garlic on the baking sheet, then roast the cauliflower for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. The garlic will need another 10-15 minutes. Allow the garlic to cool before squeezing out the cloves.
4. Cook the Soup: In a Dutch oven or soup pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add diced onions and cook until translucent, about 5-6 minutes. Stir in thyme leaves and bay leaf and cook for another 30 seconds. Pour in the broth, bring to a boil, then add the roasted cauliflower and garlic. Remove the bay leaf and puree the soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Let the soup simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Finish the Soup: Stir in the heavy cream, taste, and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If the soup is too thick, add a splash of water or broth to reach your desired consistency. Turn off the heat and stir in the white truffle oil. Serve warm!

## Tips to Improve Your Cauliflower Soup

+ **Add Parmesan or Gruyère**: For extra richness and a savory kick, stir in some freshly grated Parmesan or Gruyère cheese at the end of cooking. This will make the soup even more indulgent and creamy.
+ **Adjust the Truffle Oil**: If you’re using truffle oil, go easy. A little goes a long way. Drizzle it in at the end to keep the flavor light but luxurious, without overpowering the soup.
+ **Play with Texture**: If you like a bit of texture in your soup, reserve some of the roasted cauliflower florets and add them back in after blending. This adds visual appeal and a delightful bite.
